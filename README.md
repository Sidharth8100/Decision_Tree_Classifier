# Decision Tree Classifier in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** written in C++. The main execution file is `tree.cpp`.

## Project Overview

The Decision Tree Classifier is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. This project implements the core algorithm in C++, allowing you to build, train, and test decision trees on your datasets.

## Features

- Implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm from scratch in C++  
- Supports training and prediction on classification datasets  
- Modular and easy-to-understand code structure  

## Project Status

- The core Decision Tree Classifier is fully implemented and functional.  
- The Web Development component of this project is currently in progress and not yet completed. Please disregard any web-related files at this stage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++, clang, MSVC)

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anshu989856/DECISION-TREE-CLASSIFIER.git
   cd DECISION-TREE-CLASSIFIER
g++ -std=c++11 tree.cpp -o decision_tree
./decision_tree
